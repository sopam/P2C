Run_subprocess_4.ipynb: Create the CF_Range dataset in conjunction with cf.txt. Cf.tct is then used to calculate distances of each of the points in the counterfactual range dataset when compared to the oriignal reference datapoint.

Run_Subp[rocess_5: Here we use the actual column names instead of F1-FN]

1) get_distances_3.ipynb: Will obtain the distance of the counterfactuals from the given fold SE point.
Problrms: Obtaining the distances for all pointa and fiding min.
Step 1: Save the respective distamces for each point in a dataframe



2) Run: Has the latest software and programs for the code. Current error is that I am not able to get the distances in the final df file to check
